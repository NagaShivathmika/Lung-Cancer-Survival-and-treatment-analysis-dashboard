# Lung-Cancer-Survival-and-treatment-analysis-dashboard
An interactive Excel dashboard analyzing lung cancer survival by treatment type, cancer stage, and European region. Built using pivot tables, slicers, and data visualization techniques.

## üîç Project Objective

To explore and visualize survival patterns among lung cancer patients based on:
- Cancer stages (Stage I to IV)
- Treatment types (Chemotherapy, Radiation, Surgery, Combined)
- Demographic and lifestyle factors (Age, Gender, Smoking Status, BMI, etc.)
- Regional differences across European healthcare systems

- ## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
- Slicers for interactivity
- Conditional Formatting
- Data Cleaning (TRIM, IF, LEN, logic-based formulas)
- Dashboard Design (layout, visual hierarchy, color-coding)

**Key Visual Components:**
- **Bar Chart**: Survival Rate by Cancer Stage
- **Pie Chart**: Survival Distribution by Treatment Type
- **Bar Chart**: Treatment Distribution by Region
- **Slicers**: Enable filtering by Age Group, Gender, Smoking Status, BMI Category, Comorbidities, Treatment Status, and more

## üí° Key Insights

- **Late-stage cancer (Stage III & IV)** is strongly associated with lower survival rates.
- **Treatment types** (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, combined) show **similar survival percentages**, indicating balanced efficacy.
- **Southern Europe** reports the highest treatment volume, but with consistent distribution across treatment types.
- Patient-level factors like **BMI, smoking status, and comorbidity count** significantly influence survival outcomes.

## üéØ Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaned and organized healthcare data using Excel formulas (TRIM, IF, LEN)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovered survival patterns using pivot tables and custom visuals
- **Data Visualization**: Created interactive dashboard using slicers and dynamic charts
- **Storytelling with Data**: Designed the dashboard to communicate medical insights clearly
